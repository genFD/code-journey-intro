# `From mini JS/TS projects to a production-grade full stack application`

## 🏁 `Welcome`

Thanks for checking this repo.

This repo attempts to apply programming concepts by building simple and small projects and gradually evolve towards a
production-grade full-stack application (not a low-value project but a product-like project that could be translate into real business).

🎯 The idea is to have a collection of projects (but also notes from courses I've been taking) which can be referenced in order to :

- Review a concept
- Look up a solution to a problem
- Get an idea of a well-structured project and more...

It may also serve as a "guide" for learning how to code.

**If you want to follow this "guide", please be sure to cover the basic concepts first. Only move on to the projects section once you're happy you've understood the topic you're working on.**

Feel free to explore the codebase to get the most value out of the repo.

I'll do my best to blog about my experience building each project, by writing about the workflow, technical choices, and talking through the code.

## ⚠️ `Disclaimer`

_A word of caution_:

_These notes might be incomplete and/or contain mistakes._

_I'm maintaining it in my spare time, so if you find mistakes, please help keep this repo up-to-date by contributing._

_Also, this is not intended to be a programming course. If you decide to follow this "guide" you are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and stay consistent with your style._

_Thanks!_
