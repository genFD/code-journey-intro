# From mini JS/TS projects to a production-grade full stack application

## `🏁` Welcome

Thanks for checking this repo.

This repo attempts to showcase my journey from learning programming concepts and building simple and small projects to writing a production-grade full-stack application, using some of the best resources out there.

`🎯` The goal is to serve as a collection of notes from courses I've been taking and projects I've built that can be referenced in order to :

- Review of a concept
- Look up a solution to a problem
- Get an idea of a well-structured project and more...

It may also supposed to serve as a "guide" for learning how to code.

**If you want to follow this "guide", please be sure to cover the basic concepts first. Only move on to the projects section once you're happy you've understood the topic you're working on.**

Feel free to explore the codebase to get the most value out of the repo.

I'll do my best to blog about my experience building each project, by writing about the workflow, technical choices, and talking through the code.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

_A word of caution_:

_These notes might be incomplete and/or contain mistakes._

_I'm maintaining it in my spare time, so if you find mistakes, please help keep this repo up-to-date by contributing._

_Also, this is not intended to be a programming course. As mention above, it's a collection of notes from actual programming courses I've been taking and projects I've built. If you decide to follow this "guide" you are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and stay consistent with your style._

_Thanks!_
