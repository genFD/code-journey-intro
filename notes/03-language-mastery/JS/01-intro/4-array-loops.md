# Key Takeaways

## Arrays

- Arrays are lists that store data in JavaScript.

- Each item inside of an array is at a numbered position, or index, starting at 0.

- We can access one item in an array using its index, with syntax like: `myArray[0].`

- We can also change an item in an array using its index, with syntax like myArray[0] = 'new string';

- Variables declared with the `const` keyword cannot be reassigned. However, elements in an array declared with const remain mutable. We can change the contents of a const array, but cannot reassign a new array or a different value.

- Arrays have many methods that perform different tasks, such as `.slice()` and `.shift()`, `.push()` and `.pop()` etc..

## Loops

- it's a programming tool that repeats a set of `instructions` until a specified condition, called a `stopping condition` is reached.

- In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, `while loops` are the best choice

- In situations when we want a loop to execute a determined number of times, `for loops` are the best choice
