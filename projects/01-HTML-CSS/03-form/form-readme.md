### The challenge

The challenge is to make a `<form>` capable of collecting the correct information so that the newly crafted story makes sense!.

The logic for parsing and inserting of user inputs is already taken care of in `main.js` using JavaScript . We’ve also added some styling to the page in `style.css`

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
